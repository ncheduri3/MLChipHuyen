  [M] How do you know that your model is high variance, low bias? What would you do in this case?
    Low training error and high test error (Overfitting). Regularization can help?
  [M] How do you know that your model is low variance, high bias? What would you do in this case?
    High training error and higher test error. The model is not complex enough (underfit)
